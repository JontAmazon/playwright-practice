# TODO:
- have others written code for Parabank? Look at their code. /Forum
- testing on different devices / test.use?



# LATER CONSIDER:
- fail some test if there are javascript exceptions in the console? Maybe just during a PART of a test? Watch: https://youtu.be/jKhTcQAtIKY?si=vJXvtlA9HOEtwFry 
- API testing? And what else can I do with /services? (ask gpt?)



# SLEEP:
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));



# SKIP:
- forgot login info
- bill pay
- find transactions




# SMALL FIXES
