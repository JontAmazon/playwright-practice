# TODO:
- run all tests, one after another (or in parallel?)




# LATER CONSIDER:
- use a page object model for better maintainability?
- have others written code for Parabank? Look at their code.
- API testing? And what else can I do with /services? (ask gpt?)
- fail some test(s) if there are javascript exceptions in the console? Can I do this for just one single test? Watch: https://youtu.be/jKhTcQAtIKY?si=vJXvtlA9HOEtwFry 
    - MAYBE just during PART of a test?
- testing on different devices / test.use?




# MISC CODE NOTES
// Sleep:    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));




# SKIP:
- forgot login info
- bill pay
- find transactions
